An Anki add-on for importing quizlet flashcards

## What is this?

This is a small Python project I am creating to import quizlet flashcard as Anki flashcards. The reason I'm creating
this repo is for both learning how to write Anki addons, as also because Anki
developers [do not provide protected environments](https://ankiweb.net/account/terms). Furthermore, Quizlet sadly no
longer supports the
[Flashcard API](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60798635), meaning that any sort of support for this will require crawling
the weblink.
