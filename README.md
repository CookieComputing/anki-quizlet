An Anki add-on for importing quizlet flashcards

## What is this?
This is a small Python project I am creating to import quizlet flashcard as Anki flashcards. The reason I'm creating
this repo is for both learning how to write Anki addons, as also because Anki developers [do not provide protected
environments](https://ankiweb.net/account/terms).
